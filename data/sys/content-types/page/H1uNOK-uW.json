  "body": "This year marks 100 years since the great children's writer Roald Dahl was born. His books have entertained and inspired generations of literature lovers ever since his first title The Gremlins was published in 1943.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the late writer's achievements in literary hilarity, Oxford University Press released their Oxford Roald Dahl Dictionary: a lexicon of all things silly (and some serious), inspired by Dahl's works.\r\n\r\nHere are a few of the most ridiculous words we could find:\r\n\r\n## 1. Bopmuggered\r\nIf a giant is bopmuggered, he is in a very bad situation\r\n\r\n## 2. Lickswishy\r\nA lickswishy taste or flavour is gloriously delicious\r\n\r\n## 3. Squishous\r\nVery easy to squish\r\n\r\n## 4. Flushbunking\r\nMakes no sense whatsoever\r\n\r\n## 5. Crodsquinkled\r\nTo be caught out at something\r\n\r\n## 6. Squibbling\r\nA far more pleasing word for writing\r\n\r\n## 7. Delumptious\r\nAn alternative to delicious\r\n\r\n## 8. Quogwinkle\r\nA name for space aliens\r\n\r\n_If you're a lover of the English language, you need [our Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oh-my-word/ehcalenbnkfmddlonpfaoacalanaiide) and [Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.ohmyword.app) so you can start logging your favourite words to your own personal dictionary._",
