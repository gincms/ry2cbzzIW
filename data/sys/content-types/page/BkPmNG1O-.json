We're not entirely sure what makes them cute – it's certainly not length, nor is it necessarily their definition. Perhaps it's just the way they roll off the tongue.\r\nThese are a few of the cutest words we've come across since we've been logging our favourite words in the English language:\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bombinate\r\n> to buzz or hum.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Thimble\r\n> a small metal or plastic cap with a closed end, worn to protect the finger and push the needle in sewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Daisies\r\n> a small European grassland plant which has flowers with a yellow disc and white rays.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Glee\r\n> great delight, especially from one's own good fortune or another's misfortune.\r\n\r\n## Fribble\r\n> a frivolous or foolish person; a thing of no great importance.\r\n\r\n## Aplomb\r\n> self-confidence or assurance, especially when in a demanding situation.\r\n\r\n## Timorous\r\n> fearful or timid.\r\n\r\n## Keek\r\n> to peep surreptitiously.",
