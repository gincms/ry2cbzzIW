We're not entirely sure what makes them cute – it's certainly not length, nor is it necessarily their definition. Perhaps it's just the way they roll off the tongue.\r\nThese are a few of the cutest words we've come across since we've been logging our favourite words in the English language:\r\n\r\n* > Bombinate\r\nto buzz or hum.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Thimble\r\na small metal or plastic cap with a closed end, worn to protect the finger and push the needle in sewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Daisies\r\na small European grassland plant which has flowers with a yellow disc and white rays.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Glee\r\ngreat delight, especially from one's own good fortune or another's misfortune.\r\n\r\n> Fribble\r\na frivolous or foolish person; a thing of no great importance.\r\n\r\n> Aplomb\r\nself-confidence or assurance, especially when in a demanding situation.\r\n\r\n> Timorous\r\nfearful or timid.\r\n\r\n> Keek\r\nto peep surreptitiously.",
