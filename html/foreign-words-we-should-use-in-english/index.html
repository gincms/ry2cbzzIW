Sometimes you want a single term that will hit the spot.</p> <p>Below are a few foreign words which do just that. Enjoy dropping these into everyday conversation...</p> <h2 id="1-hygge">1. Hygge</h2> <p>This is a wonderful Danish word and it refers to a lifestyle we should all endeavour to lead. <em>Hygge</em> means creating a warm atmosphere and enjoying the good things in life with good people. This could mean a cup of tea by the fire on a cosy sofa with your cat if you&#39;re an <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ailurophile">ailurophile</a>, or perhaps a feast of your favourite foods with family and friends.</p> <h2 id="2-kummerspeck">2. Kummerspeck</h2> <p>It&#39;s not as filthy as it sounds, we swear. <em>Kummerspeck</em> is actually a German word for weight we gain from comfort eating. It could well be something you can refer to once you&#39;ve had your fill of <em>hygge</em> (see above).</p> <h2 id="3-iktsuarpok">3. Iktsuarpok</h2> <p>We&#39;ve all been there: your friend or partner on their way to your house and you know they&#39;re due any minute. You&#39;re so anxious about their arrival and potentially missing the doorbell ring that you keep going out to check. That&#39;s <em>iktsuarpok</em>. Thanks to Inuits, for this little gem.</p> <h2 id="4-gigil">4. Gigil</h2> <p>Cute aggression: it&#39;s a thing. It&#39;s that bursting feeling you get when you see a fluffy kitten sleeping or spring lamb bounding through green fields. There&#39;s so much excitement, you actually feel a little bit violent. In Filipino, this urge to pinch or squeeze something cute is called <em>gigil</em>.</p> <h2 id="5-l-esprit-de-l-escalier">5. L’esprit de l’escalier</h2> <p>In French, this literally translates to &#39;stairwell wit&#39;. But it refers to that witty retort you thought of when it was too late. We&#39;ve all suffered with l’esprit de l’escalier.</p> <h2 id="6-pelinti">6. Pelinti</h2> <p>How there isn&#39;t a word for this in English already, we don&#39;t know. You know when you&#39;re too excited to tuck into your dinner so you dive straight in, but it&#39;s piping hot so you have to tilt your head back, breathe through it and move it around your mouth? That, my friends, is what the Ghanaians call <em>pelinti</em>.</p> <h2 id="7-komorebi">7. Komorebi</h2> <p>This rather beautiful little word refers to the sunlight that filters through trees in Japanese.</p> <h2 id="8-pana-po-oing">8. Pana po’oing</h2> <p>This is what we do when we walk into a room then forget what we came in for. That confused, head-scratching action is called – in Hawaiian – <em>pana po’oing</em>.</p> <h2 id="9-seigneur-terraces">9. Seigneur-terraces</h2> <p>In the age of the freelancer, we all know a few of these (and have probably been guilty of it ourselves, too). <em>Seigneur-terraces</em>, in French, refers to someone who sits in a coffee shop for a long time but spends little money.</p> <h2 id="10-boketto">10. Boketto</h2> <p>This action, <em>boketto</em>, is something we&#39;ve all done – and probably quite frequently. We&#39;re glad the Japanese have given staring into the distance at nothing a name.</p> <h2 id="11-zeg">11. Zeg</h2> <p>This handy little word could save us all some breath: it&#39;s Georgian for the day after tomorrow. We wonder if that&#39;s what the movie was called over there...</p> <h2 id="12-tsundoku">12. Tsundoku</h2> <p>We&#39;re beginning to think the Japanese have a word for everything. This one&#39;s a term for the act of buying a book and not reading it. Come on, we&#39;ve all done it...</p> <h2 id="13-voorpret">13. Voorpret</h2> <p>Pre-party excitement, that&#39;s what this is. <em>Voorpret</em>, in Dutch, is the feeling of enjoyment before an event takes place.</p> <h2 id="15-d-paysement">15. Dépaysement</h2> <p>Some of us enjoy this feeling, but others dread it: <em>dépaysement</em>, in French, is that sense of disorientation when in a foreign country or culture.</p> <h2 id="16-fernweh">16. Fernweh</h2> <p>When wanderlust doesn&#39;t cut it, use fernweh. This lovely little German term is not just the desire to travel, but the need.</p> <h2 id="17-lagom">17. Lagom</h2> <p>Not too much, not too little – <em>lagom</em> is just the right amount (in Swedish).</p> <h2 id="18-utepils">18. Utepils</h2> <p>For a country with so few hours of daily sunlight daily, this is something Norwegians cherish so much they made a word for it. <em>Utepils</em> is the act of sitting outside to enjoy a beer on a sunny day.</p> <p><em>If you&#39;re a lover of the English language, you need <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oh-my-word/ehcalenbnkfmddlonpfaoacalanaiide">our Chrome extension</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.ohmyword.app">Android App</a> so you can start logging your favourite words to your own personal dictionary.</em></p> </section> </article> </div> </div> </section> </div> </section> <footer class="footer has-text-centered"> <div class="container"> <ul class="nav-center omw-nav"> <li class="nav-item"><a href="https://twitter.com/ohMyWordxyz" target="_blank" title="Follow us on Twitter"><i class="omwicon-twitter"></i></a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ohMyWordxyz" target="_blank" title="Folow us on Facebook"><i class="omwicon-facebook"></i></a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="https://twitter.com/ohMyWordxyz" target="_blank" title="Send us your words"><i class="omwicon-email"><i></i></i></a></li><li class="nav-item">|&nbsp;</li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/about/" title="About Oh My Word!">About</a></li><li class="nav-item">&nbsp;|&nbsp;</li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/contact/" title="Contact">Contact</a></li><li class="nav-item">&nbsp;|&nbsp;</li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/privacy/" title="Privacy">Privacy</a></li><li class="nav-item">&nbsp;|&nbsp;</li><li class="nav-item">Oh My Word! © 2016</li> </ul> </div> </footer> <!-- Gin foot --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
