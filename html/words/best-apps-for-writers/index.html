In the early 1900s, only 23 per cent of the world&#39;s population were literate. Today, there&#39;s an 83 per cent literacy rate across our globe thanks to wider access to education and advances in technology. While some will have started out using typewriters, today there&#39;s a whole host of tech that enhances our ability to communicate with the written word, and thanks to the rise of the internet and the smartphone, there&#39;s plenty of cool software too. Here are a few of the best applications for writers:</p> <h2 id="1-expand-your-vocabulary-with-oh-my-word-">1. Expand your vocabulary with Oh My Word!</h2> <p>Of course we couldn&#39;t leave our own Chrome extension out. If your writing needs more variety, we&#39;re here to help. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oh-my-word/ehcalenbnkfmddlonpfaoacalanaiide">Oh My Word!</a> (a Chrome extension – mobile app in progress) allows you to save your favourite words to your own personal dictionary.

Keep your favourite writing in your Pocket</h2> <p>A writer must write, write and write some more. That&#39;s the general rule. But you must also read – perhaps even more than you write.

Pocket is available for iOS and Android for free.</p> <h2 id="4-write-from-anywhere-with-google-docs">4.

You can write and edit on Google Docs from anywhere – as long as you&#39;ve got a laptop, computer, tablet or smartphone to hand. Google Docs is free – but you must have a Google account (also free).</p> <h2 id="5-do-everything-with-evernote">5. Do everything with Evernote</h2> <p>&quot;The workspace for your life&#39;s work&quot; is a pretty accurate description of what <a href="https://evernote.com/?var=c">Evernote</a> is.
