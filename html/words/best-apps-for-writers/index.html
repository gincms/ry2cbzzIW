In the early 1900s, only 23 per cent of the world&#39;s population were literate. Today, there&#39;s an 83 per cent literacy rate across our globe thanks to wider access to education and advances in technology. While some will have started out using typewriters, today there&#39;s a whole host of tech that enhances our ability to communicate with the written word, and thanks to the rise of the internet and the smartphone, there&#39;s plenty of cool software too. Here are a few of the best applications for writers:</p> <h2 id="1-expand-your-vocabulary-with-oh-my-word-">1. Expand your vocabulary with Oh My Word!</h2> <p>Of course we couldn&#39;t leave our own Chrome extension out.
