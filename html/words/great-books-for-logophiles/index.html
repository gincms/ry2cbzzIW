While it&#39;s not World Book Day anymore, we&#39;re still logophiles. So if you&#39;re a lover of the English language, here are a few brilliant books you&#39;ll enjoy:</p> <h2 id="1-for-all-things-etymology">1. For all things etymology</h2> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Etymologicon-Circular-through-Connections-Language/dp/1848313071/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="><em>The Etymologicon: A Circular Stroll through the Hidden Connections of the English Language</em></a> by Mark Forsyth is brilliant. It begins with a study of the word books, or more specifically the phrase a turn up for the books, and from there explores how chickens are linked to gambling and that &quot;Alexander the Great conquered half the world without even a café latte to perk him up.&quot; Forsyth has a number of other excellent word-nerd books, including <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Horologicon-Jaunt-Through-English-Language/dp/1848314159/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">one about lost words</a> of the English language which is bound to expand your ever-elegant vocabulary.</p> <h2 id="2-for-endless-collective-nouns">2. For endless collective nouns</h2> <p>Okay so it&#39;s not endless, but there are over 1100 collective nouns in James Lipton&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Exaltation-Larks-James-Lipton/dp/0140170960"><em>An Exaltation of Larks</em></a>.</p> <h2 id="3-for-next-level-eloquence">3. For next-level eloquence</h2> <p>Try anything by Jane Austen. This literary lady is quoted more than 1600 times in the Oxford English Dictionary, and has made a variety of phrases part of our everyday language. <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/10-of-the-best-words-from-jane-austens-novels/"><em>She&#39;s the Queen of Words</em></a>, especially with her use of terms like &#39;panegyric&#39; and &#39;counterpoise&#39;.</p> <h2 id="4-for-sharp-wit">4. For sharp wit</h2> <p>Almost anything by Oscar Wilde will please a logophile, but this little book, <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/292318/only-dull-people-are-brilliant-at-breakfast/#DdG3E1mJhY9iXmei.99"><em>Only Dull People are Brilliant at Breakfast</em></a>, containing &quot;witticisms on the dangers of sincerity, duplicitous biographers, and the stupidity of the English&quot; is perhaps the icing on the literary cake.</p> <h2 id="5-for-a-history-of-english">5. For a history of English</h2> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mother-Tongue-Story-English-Language/dp/0141040084/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1456855566&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=history+of+language"><em>Mother Tongue: The Story of the English Language</em></a> by Bill Bryson is as funny and entertaining as his travel writing. This book takes you on a journey through the English language, examining its history from humble beginnings to one of the world&#39;s most widely-spoken languages.</p> <h2 id="6-for-interesting-idioms">6. For interesting idioms</h2> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-You-Say-Fascinating-Everyday/dp/1595552995/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="><em>Why You Say It</em></a> is much like the Etyomologicon, but focuses on English idioms instead of individual words. From beating around the bush, to tasting humble pie, this delightful read will educate and entertain.</p> <h2 id="7-for-grammar-geeks">7. For grammar geeks</h2> <p>Punctuation doesn&#39;t have to be boring, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eats-Shoots-Leaves-Lynne-Truss/dp/0007329067/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="><em>Eats Shoots &amp; Leaves</em></a> is the perfect testament to that. Author Lynne Truss takes the reader on a tour of the rules of grammar and punctuation.</p> <h2 id="8-for-excellent-expletives">8. For excellent expletives</h2> <p>Did you know the word &#39;fuck&#39; first appeared in the English language in the fifteenth century? Nor did we, until we read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/F-Word-Jesse-Sheidlower/dp/0571197302"><em>The F-Word</em></a> – a novel by Jesse Sheidlower about one of the most-popular expletives, its origins and its many, often rather creative, uses.</p> </section> </article> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> </article> <footer class="footer has-text-centered"> !nav </footer> </body> </html>
